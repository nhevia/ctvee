## Summary

This is a personal project. A site where you can search TV series and all relevant information about them.  
Series list is refreshed weekly from TVMaze public API into AWS (to reduce API requests on their side). Runtime queries (series details) are still being requested from TVMaze API.

> Note: old project, not being mantained. *Maybe* in the future...
